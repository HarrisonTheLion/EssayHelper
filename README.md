EssayHelper
===========

Welcome to EssayHelper: a Java Applet to help show you words that might be overused in your essays.
Currently the applet has two major functions. Firstly, the "redundancy" highlights words or phrases in your essay that might be redundant and only add uneccessary fluff.
Secondly, the "frequency" button creates a list of all the words in the essay as well as how frequently they are used, which can help to point out overused words in your essay.

The source code for the Java Applet can be found in the "src" folder.
